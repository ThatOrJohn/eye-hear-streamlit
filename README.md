# Eyehear 👁️👂

A [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app using [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) to transcribe doorbell camera video.  The uploaded video is transcribed, and this transcription is converted to audio which is automatically played.  Video details are stored in a Firestore db.

This could be particularly handy for the sight-impaired, although anyone that doesn't feel like watching the video clip would benefit.
